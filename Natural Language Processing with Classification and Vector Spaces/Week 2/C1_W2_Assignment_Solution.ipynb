    "* The function takes in the `tweet`, `logprior`, `loglikelihood`.\n",
    "* It returns the probability that the tweet belongs to the positive or negative class.\n",

    "\n",
    "The value of 0.0 means that when we add the logprior to the log likelihood, we're just adding zero to the log likelihood.  However, please remember to include the logprior, because whenever the data is not perfectly balanced, the logprior will be a non-zero value."
